  <b>Powerful cross-platform C2 infrastructure</b><br>
  Built with Qt, Go, and Docker for a seamless GUI experience and streamlined payload handling.
</p>

---

ðŸš§ Prerequisites
Docker (v20+)

X11 (Linux host, for GUI forwarding)

Qt5-compatible system if running outside Docker

ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions

Create Payload Directory
```bash
mkdir payloads
```

This directory will be mounted into the container for access to dropped/generated payloads.

Enable X11 Forwarding (Linux Desktop)
```bash
xhost +local:root
```

This allows the container to render the Qt GUI on your desktop.

Build and Launch the Adaptix Client
```bash
cd Client
docker build -t adaptix-client .
```
```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
  -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
  -v $PWD/payloads:/app/payloads \
  adaptix-client
```

Build and Launch the Adaptix Server
```bash
cd Server

docker build -t adaptix-server .
```

If successful, youâ€™ll see the full GUI interface. Payloads will be saved inside ./payloads.

Launch the Adaptix C2 Server
```bash
docker run --rm -it --name adaptix-server -p 50203:50203 adaptix-server:latest
```

This exposes the C2 server on port 50203.
Retrieve the C2 Server IP (From Another Terminal)

```bash
docker exec -t adaptix-server ifconfig
```

Look for the containerâ€™s IP (usually under eth0).

Payload Directory Usage
Any payloads dropped/generated by the client will be available in ./payloads on the host.

Easily transfer implants, stagers, and logs from within the container.

Development Notes
Built with Go 1.23, Qt 5.x, and CMake 3.31+

Uses X11 forwarding for desktop integration


ðŸ§¤ Troubleshooting
GUI doesnâ€™t show? â†’ Ensure xhost +local:root was run.

QSQLITE not loaded? â†’ Make sure libqt5sql5-sqlite is installed.

Permission denied on payloads? â†’ Use a bind mount and chmod 777 payloads if needed.

I'm still investigating the root cause of this issue and will continue refining the implementation.
While I'm not an expert, I'm actively learning and improving as I go.
